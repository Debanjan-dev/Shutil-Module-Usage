# Shutil Module Usage: Practical Examples

This repository provides hands-on examples demonstrating the power of Python's `shutil` module for common file and directory operations.

## Why Shutil?

The `shutil` module simplifies everyday tasks like:

-  **Copying:** Files and entire directories
-  **Moving:** Relocating files and directories
-  **Deleting:** Removing files and directories safely
-  **Archiving:** Creating and extracting zip archives
-  **Disk Management:** Getting disk usage information

## Examples

1. **`1_coping_files.py`:** Copy a single file.
2. **`2_coping_directories.py`:** Copy an entire directory and its contents.
3. **`3_creating_Zip_archive.py`:** Create a zip archive from a directory.
4. **`4_extracting_Zip_archive.py`:** Extract the contents of a zip archive.
5. **`5_disk_usage.py`:** Retrieve disk usage statistics (total, used, free space).
6. **`6_moving_files_directories.py`:** Move a file or directory to a new location.
7. **`7_removing_directory.py`:** Safely delete an entire directory and its contents.
